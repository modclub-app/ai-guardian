AI-Guardian: A project that integrates AI with blockchain technology to safeguard DeFi ecosystems, using smart contracts to detect and prevent malicious activities within DAOs, ensuring enhanced security and governance.

This project sets out to revolutionize the security and governance frameworks of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) by weaving AI canisters into their treasury voting mechanisms. This innovative strategy combines the immutable and transparent essence of blockchain smart contracts with the discerning capabilities of artificial intelligence. The ambition is to cultivate a DeFi ecosystem that minimizes risks associated with human flaws, susceptibility to undue influence, and greed. The overarching goal is to employ AI's analytical strengths to foster more secure and dependable treasury management across DAOs, thereby contributing to a more stable and credible DeFi environment.

The initial phase of the project is dedicated to developing a standardized dataset that will serve as a benchmark for evaluating performance. This involves a meticulous analysis of voting records from snapshot.org to identify and categorize malicious proposals. These include attempts at treasury draining, demands similar to those made during the Mango Hacker incident, and other violations of treasury charters. Given the limitations posed by the scarcity of data, the project plans to leverage synthetic data generation techniques to augment the dataset, ensuring a thorough representation of potential security threats.

Future phases will focus on implementing this AI-based security mechanism within DAOs operating on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and subsequently extending its application to DAOs built on Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs). This phased approach allows for iterative refinement and adaptation of the AI canisters, ensuring they can effectively operate across different blockchain environments and protect against a broad spectrum of malicious activities. Through this endeavor, the project aims to establish a new standard for DAO treasury management, making them impervious to the pitfalls of human error and malfeasance and leading the way toward a more secure and trustworthy DeFi landscape.
